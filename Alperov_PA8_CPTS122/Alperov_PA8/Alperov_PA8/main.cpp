Assingment Programming Assingment 8
Task: Our goal for this assingment is to create a Data Analysis using Binary Search Trees (BST) in respect to good
decision making of BigO which is time complexity. There will be several classes involved including some inheritance 
playing a role and some new returns such as virtual. Overall should be pretty lightwork to complete
based off the previous assingments and experience that we have built in our hands.
